# How to use

The command line interface can be used to list various tables in the database.
The first arguments is the table name and the second is the action.
For example if I wanted to list all observations of pulsar J1652-4838 I could use:

```
psrdb observations list --pulsar J1652-4838
```

If you're unsure which arguments you require you can use `-h` to list your options.
